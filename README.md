Darkerula
=========

A bit darker Darcula

This is a *hack*. IntelliJ does not support custom UI colors, but I hope it will soon!

Problems
========
* This plugin will automatically force your IDE into a darker UI each time the IDE launches. If you don't like it, uninstall it.
* If you switch to the default theme then back to Darcula, it will load the default Darcula settings, not mine. You will need to restart the IDE to load this theme.
* There is nothing I can do to fix 1 and 2.
