Darkerula

A bit darker Darcula

This is a *hack*. IntelliJ does not support custom UI colors, but I hope it will soon!

Install
========
- Download https://github.com/johnlindquist/Darkerula/blob/master/Darkerula.jar?raw=true
- Preferences->Plugins->Install plugin from disk
- Restart

Problems
========
* This plugin will automatically force your IDE into a darker UI each time the IDE launches. If you don't like it, uninstall it.
* If you switch to the default theme then back to Darcula, it will load the default Darcula settings, not mine. You will need to restart the IDE to load this theme.
